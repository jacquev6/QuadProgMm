Linear and quadratic forms
==========================

Quadratic problems aim at optimizing a quadratic form of several variables,
subject to linear constraints on these variables.

So, let's start with variables::

    QP::Variable a, b, c, d;

This defines four instances representing the variables of your QP problem.
